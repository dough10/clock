# clock.py

clock.py is a python ascii art clock I am running on an old raspberry pi with the touchscreen and raspian lite

I think my plan is to make an over complicated alarm clock that pulls time from google calendar

## install

copy the code below and paste into command line

`cd ~/ && curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dough10/clock/refs/heads/main/install.sh && bash install.sh && rm install.sh`
